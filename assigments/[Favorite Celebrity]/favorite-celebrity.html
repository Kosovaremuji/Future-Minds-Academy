            <h2><i>Biography</i></h2>
            <p> <b><i>Selena Marie Gomez</i></b> is an American singer, actress, businesswoman, and producer. She was
                born on July 22, 1992, in Grand Prairie, Texas, to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Texas-born former stage
                actress Mandy Teefey. She was named after Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla, who died in 1995. Her father
                is of Mexican descent, while her mother, who was adopted, has Italian ancestry.Gomez's paternal
                grandparents emigrated to Texas from Monterrey in the 1970s.
                Of her heritage, Gomez has said she is "a proud third-generation American-Mexican" and "My family does
                have quinceañeras, and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't
                really have anything traditional except go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church."
                Gomez was fluent in Spanish until age seven.Her parents divorced when she was five years old, and she
                remained with her mother.
                Gomez has two younger half-sisters and a younger stepbrother: Gracie Elliot Teefey, through Mandy and
                her second husband, Brian Teefey, and Victoria "Tori" and Marcus Gomez, through Ricardo and his second
                wife, Sara. She earned her high-school diploma through homeschooling in May 2010.

                Gomez was born when her mother was 16 years old.The family had financial troubles throughout Gomez's
                childhood, her mother struggling to provide for the pair. At one point, Gomez recalls that they had to
                search for quarters just to get gas for their car. Her mother later recalled that the two would
                frequently walk to their local dollar store to buy spaghetti for dinner.
                Gomez has said, "I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end
                of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I
                would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas]." She later added that her mother "was really strong around
                me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three
                jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me."
                Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child and appeared in various pageants. Her
                grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and she has said they
                "raised her" until she found success in show business.
