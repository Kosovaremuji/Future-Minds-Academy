        Oftentimes you give others the opportunity to
        create your happiness, and many times they fail to create it the way you want it. Why? Because only one person
        can be incharge of your joy, of your bliss, and that's you. So even your parent, your child, your spouse—they do
        not have
        the control to create your happiness.
        They simply have the opportunity to share in your happiness. Your Joy lies within you.All your joy is on the
        frequency of love—the highest and the most powerful frequency of all. You can't hold love in your hand. <img

        can only fee/ it in your heart. It 1s a state of being. You can see evidence of love being expressed through
        people, but love 1s a feeling, and you are the only one that can radiate and emit that feeling of love. Your
        ability to generate feelings of love is unlimited, and when you love you are in complete and utter harmony
        with the Universe. Love everything you can. Love everyone you can. Focus only on things you love, feel love,
        and you will experience that love and joy coming back to you—multiplied! The law of attraction must send you
        back more things to love. As you radiate love, it will appear as though the entire Universe is doing
        everything for you, moving every joyful thing to you, and moving every good person to you. In truth, it
